# foddomator

this repo is an open-source version of the code that powers our foddomator project

# Introduction

Feeding cattle is a time and
resource-consuming process that can
use automation as a way to make it more
efficient, environmentally aware and
better for the animalsâ€™ quality of life.
When the number of animals
becomes bigger it becomes harder
to make sure that every animal is
eating their food on time and eating
enough, drinking enough water and
sometimes their medicine.

# Project Name

The project name consists of two parts `Fodd` taken from the word
`Fodder` which means ***food given to cows, horses, and other farm animals***.
And the second part `omator` is from the word `Automator` which means ***a
device that emulates tasks typically performed by people***.

# Objective

Our goal is to develop a device that dispenses food at the right time
for the right animal, refills water and dispenses medicine in the right amount.

# Process

**First:** we made a vocabulary tree to use while
searching the web for related devices and topics.<br>
**Second:** while searching the web we gathered all
related images to make a mood board to help us
visualize our device and how it could work. Mood Board
Link.<br>
**Third:** we developed testing
criteria to judge our designs, and from
there we came up with a few
concepts.<br>
**Fourth:** prototype our concepts
and test different designs.<br>
**Fifth:** test prototypes using the test criteria.
Sixth: improve and fix design flaws.
